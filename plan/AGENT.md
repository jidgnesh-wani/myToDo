# Plan & Analysis

## Purpose

Own project planning documents, flow analysis, and implementation plans. These are living artifacts that guide development work.

## Ownership

All files under `plan/`.

## Local Contracts

- Plans must reference specific files and line numbers where changes are needed
- Flow analysis must map user-visible symptoms to code-level failure points
- Keep plans scoped and actionable; avoid vague goals

## Work Guidance

- New plans: create in `plan/` with a descriptive name and `---` frontmatter
- Cross-reference existing plans to avoid duplicate work
- Delete obsolete plans; do not leave stale ones

## Verification

None yet.
